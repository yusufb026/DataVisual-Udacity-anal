# BikeGo Data Exploration

## Dataset

I used the BikeGo Dataset available [here].(https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data&sa=D&ust=1554486256012000)

## Summary of Findings

We understand that Go Bike is an excellent initiative and a great business endeavour. This is beneficial for both 
the environment and for the cusotmers who can easily use the bikes to commute small distances.

The startup also seems to be growing steadily through the years.

We also understand from the data that -

20-35 year olds are the target audience for this startup
Summer is the peak season for rides
Round Trips are less common than point to point trips
Women tend to take longer trip than any other gender
Younger riders are more likely to take trips lasting a longer duration.
Another great thing is the fact that the company decided to open source their datasets, which allowed us to perform this
 analysis!
 
 
## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation I decided it would be appropriate to skip or hide all of the code slides and just display the plots.

I also went one step ahead and added appropriate titles for all of the plots which made them easier to read. 

I start by showing a distribution of the rider ages for the members. Then I proceed to Bivariate relationships 
and explore those deeply. Here I explored the relation between the duration of the ride and the age of the rider. 
Then I explore the gender distribution for subscribers and customers. After that I analyzed the riding habits of subscribers
vs customers.

For the multivariate distribution, I compared the duration of the rider, their age and gender, then I explored what types
of trips were more common and for which genders. I analyzed the total number of riders for different months wtr. to their genders. 

At several places I added helpful descriptions and explanations to make the understanding easier.
